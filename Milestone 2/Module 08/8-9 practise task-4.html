            <h2>Health is wealth</h2>
            <p>A healthy diet starts early in life - breastfeeding fosters healthy growth, and may have longer-term
            health benefits, like reducing the risk of becoming overweight or obese and developing noncommunicable
            diseases later in life.
            Feeding babies exclusively with breast milk from birth to 6 months of life is important for a healthy
            diet. It is also important to introduce a variety of safe and nutritious complementary foods at 6 months
            of age, while continuing to breastfeed until your child is two years old and beyond.

            <h2>Health is wealth</h2>
            <p>Fast food can have negative effects on health due to being high in calories, unhealthy fats, sodium, and sugar, while being low in essential nutrients and fiber. These factors can lead to serious long-term issues like obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension, as well as immediate problems such as digestive discomfort and energy crashes. It is also linked to a higher risk of certain cancers, liver disease, and mental health issues like depression</p>
